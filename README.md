# decisiontree 
<br>
This is the decision tree algorithm, implemented from scratch. In the algorithm.py file, the function of the elgorithm works in the following parts. <br>
- The classes of the Decision Tree and Decision Node. The Decision Tree is the superclass of both the regression and classifiaction decision tree.
- The major function is to the build_tree function, this builds a tree using recursion on both left and right side based on the value compared by threshold value. <br>
- The predict_value function places the the y variable, based on recursion again.
- The build_tree function creates the tree in the form of a flowchart.
The different implementations in this algorithms are XGBoost, Regression and Classification with changes in impurity and leaf value calculation
